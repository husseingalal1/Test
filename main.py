Pneumonia is a respiratory infection caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi. Did you know that pneumonia accounts
for approximately 14% of all deaths of children under 5 years old [1]? However, the disease can be dangerous for
adults as well [2]. Chest x-ray is currently the best way to reliably detect pneumonia. But the diagnosis relies
on the trained eye of a radiologist [3].

We use machine learning to analyse chest x-ray images. Our goal is to implement an app which can ultimately detect
pneumonia and help physicians to reliably diagnose pneumonia. Just kidding, we are not trying to change the world
